# ConstructorExercise

This project demonstrates how to use a constructor to create custom chess pieces. 
It also implements a simplified version of PieceSelector.java from the prior project, ArrayExercise.

Pieces in this program are objects organized in a two dimensional array by faction and type with 
easy to alter properties of name, faction, value, and soon, movements options.
